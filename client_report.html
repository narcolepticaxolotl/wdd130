            <h3>Client Report</h3>
            <ul><li>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?<br></li>
                The only image I sent to my developer was the logo image I created. The rest of the content was just pretty obvious for the type of site I wanted to see made.<br>
                <li>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?<br></li>
                I communicated with my developer by email. We had no issues with communication.<br>
                <li>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?<br></li>
                Those who worked on my site did a great job. I was very happy with the result. It doesn't look like it works like I imagined it could, but I know that wasn't the point of this project. Mostly all they needed to do was to make it look good. They did make it look like the wireframes I made.<br>
                <li>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?<br></li>
                If I ever hire others to work on any similar project for me, it will probably be a project I care more about, and so I'll probably communicate a lot more often with the team and give more feedback and instruction.<br>

            <h3>Lead dev Report</h3>
            <ul><li>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?<br></li>
                For the most part, I let my junior devs do as they pleased and I focused on developing the main page of my client's site.<br>
                <li>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?<br></li>
                I communicated with my client by text and by email. We had no issues and he gave me no feedback.<br>
                <li>How did you handle publishing your client's site and sharing it with the client?<br></li>
                I published the site on GitHub and sent the link to my client via email.<br>
                <li>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?<br></li>
                I like the main function of GitHub; to allow several people to work on the same project without much risk of undoing anyone's work. But I had a hard time using the website. It didn't seem intuitive to me. The fact that publishing changes takes a while to take effect was frustrating.<br>

            </ul>
            <h3>Junior dev Report</h3>
            <ul><li>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?<br></li>
                With my first team lead, things went more or less smoothly, except I had to ask for the wireframe since he forgot to send it along with the rest of the site plan. With the second, I don't think it was his fault, but it was a while before we got our site plan. After we had them, I worked steadily on the site over the last few weeks.<br>
                <li>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?<br></li>
                Given the site plans and wireframes, I had what I needed to work on and develop my pages. I didn't have any questions and I didn't receive any feedback.<br>
                <li>Were you able to contribute to your sites?<br></li>
                I did contribute to the projects I was assigned to help with.<br>
                <li>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?<br></li>
                No, contributing through GitHub as a collaborator was much easier than doing so as the publisher. I really just had to download the projects and work on them and upload my changes.<br>
                <li>Links to sites:<br></li>
                <a href="https://soaringeaqle.github.io/wdd130-archibald/">https://soaringeaqle.github.io/wdd130-archibald/</a><br>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <ul><li>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?<br></li>
                For me, the most challenging part was dealing with GitHub. It was confusing and annoying, even with the instructions the site gives us.<br>
                <li>What did you enjoy most about this project?<br></li>
                I thought it was kind of a fun twist that we were told to come up with a project and then that others would work on it. But the most enjoyable part was just knowing that I'm practicing and improving my skills.<br>
                <li>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?<br></li>
                I would like to do this again after I learn a lot more JavaScript and specifically learn how to use it to manipulate HTML. The nicest things I've learned in this class have been scripts.<br>
                <li>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.<br></li>
                I would certainly feel more confident working on a real project after this. I can't say I'm confident in knowing the workings of GitHub, but now I know where my weakness is and I'm better prepared to fix it. I also know a little more about working with HTML and CSS than I did before this project, and a lot more than I knew before taking this class.</ul>
